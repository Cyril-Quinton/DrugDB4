DrugDB4

A software developped with QTCreator 3.0. 
This project was part of a master degree course called "Programation orientée objet" in Bordeaux University (France) and was realised by Quentin Riché-Piotaix and Cyril Quinton.

It allows to make fast requests on files containing drugs and their side effects. (testFile/save3.txt is this kind of file). It allows to modify and doing requests on these "databases".
